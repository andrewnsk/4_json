# Prettify JSON

A script that takes the input to a path to a file with arbitrary data
in JSON format and displays its content in the console in an easy-to-read form,
the so-called Pretty Print

#

An example of running a script on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash

$ python pprint_json.py <path to file>
```

You can download json data from https://data.mos.ru/opendata/1854 (-> Скачать -> .json )

Example output:

```json
{
    "age": 45,
    "city": "Mukhosransk",
    "name": "Vasya"
}
```
